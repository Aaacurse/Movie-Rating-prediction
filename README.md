Movie Rating Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a Python-based movie rating prediction system that utilizes a linear regression model to predict movie ratings. It also includes data visualization and data analysis to gain insights from the dataset. The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle and various Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn were used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes various attributes of movies, such as director, cast, genre, runtime, and more. The target variable is the movie rating, which we aim to predict using a linear regression model.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link: [Movie Rating Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:


Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Linear Regression Model
We use a linear regression model to predict movie ratings based on the features in the dataset. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

Data Visualization and Analysis
The Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory contain data visualization and analysis to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on movie ratings. We use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or find issues in the project, please create an issue or submit a pull request.
